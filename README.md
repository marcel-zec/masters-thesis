# Transformation of business processes into application processes
Master's thesis

#### Abstract
The diploma thesis focuses on the transformation of business processes into application processes using the workflow tool Camunda. The thesis introduces the reader to business management and describes the problems it has gone through. It describes the trends that help solve these problems. To accomplish the goals of the work, we first analyzed the MMABP methodology,  which is utilized for analyzing and modeling business processes.  Furthermore, we analyzed the methodological procedure for converting conceptual models into implementation-independent technological models. Additionally, we analyzed the Camunda workflow tool. 
The outcome of this research is a systematic approach to transforming business processes into application processes using the Camunda tool. This approach consists of two distinct procedures.  Firstly, an enhanced and refined methodological process is proposed for transforming conceptual models, developed through the utilization of the MMABP methodology, into technological models. Secondly, a methodical procedure is introduced for transforming technological models into implementation models specific to Camunda 8 platform.
